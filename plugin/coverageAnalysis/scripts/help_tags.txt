@Target Base Coverage
Summary statistics for targeted base reads of the reference.
A base covered by multiple target regions will only be counted once per sequencing read.

@Number of mapped reads
Total number of reads mapped to the reference.

@Number of reads on target
Total number of filtered reads mapped to any targeted region of the reference. A read is considered to be on target
if at least one aligned base overlaps a target region.
If no target regions (file) was specified this value will be the percentage of reads passing uniquely mapped
and/or non-duplicate filters, or 100% if no filters where specified.

@Percent reads on target
The percentage of filtered reads mapped to any targeted region relative to all reads mapped to the reference.
A read is considered on target if at least one aligned base overlaps at least one target region.
If no target regions (file) was specified this value will be the percentage of reads passing uniquely mapped
and/or non-duplicate filters, or 100% if no filters where specified.

@Percent reads on padded target
The percentage of filtered reads mapped to any padded targeted region relative to all reads mapped to the reference.
A read is considered on target if at least one aligned base overlaps at least one padded target region.
This typically includes reads of probe-enriched DNA fragments that overlapped a target region but were only
sequenced over bases flanking that region.

@Total aligned base reads
The total number of bases covered by reads aligned to the reference.
Clipped bases, deletions and inserts (relative to the reference) are not included in this total.

@Total base reads on target
The total number of bases in targeted regions covered by any number of aligned reads. 
(If no specific target regions was specified the targeted regions is the whole reference genome.)
Clipped bases, deletions and inserts (relative to the reference) are not included in this total.

@Percent base reads on target
The percent of all bases covered by reads aligned to the reference that covered bases in target regions.
(If no specific target regions was specified the targeted regions is the whole reference genome.)

mapped reads are not considered. Covered reference target bases may include sample DNA read base mismatches
but does not include read base deletions in the read.

@Average base coverage depth
The average number of reads of all targeted reference bases. This is the total number of base reads on
target divided by the number of targeted bases and therefore includes any bases that had no coverage.

@Target bases with no strand bias
The percentage of all target bases that did not show a bias towards forward or reverse strand
read alignments. An individual target base is considered to have read bias if it has at least 10 
reads and the fraction of forward or reverse reads to total reads is greater than 70%.

@Amplicon Read Coverage
Summary statistics for reads assigned to specific amplicons.
Each sequence read will be assigned to exactly one of the amplicons specified by the targets file.
Reads are assigned to particular amplicon targets based if thier (5') mapping location being suffiently
close to the end of the amplicon region, taking the read direction (mapping strand) in to account.

@Number of amplicons
The number of amplicons specified in the target regions file.

@Percent assigned amplicon reads (strict)
The total number of reads that were assigned to individual amplicons.
A read is assigned to a particular (inner) amplicon region if the start of the read is within -30 to +5
of region start. Read orientation (the strand it is mapped to) is taken into account such that the 5'
end is compared to the amplicon start for forward reads and to the amplicon end for reverse reads, given
that the amplicon region is defined with respect to the forward reference strand.
If a read might be associated with multiple amplicons this way it is assigned to the amplicon region
that has the greatest overlap of aligned sequence.
Note that this value may be less than the 'Percent reads on target' value since some reads may not be
assigned if they do not meet the assigment criteria even though they may have aligned bases that overlap
an amplicon region.

@Percent assigned amplicon reads
The total number of reads that were assigned to individual amplicons.
A read is assigned to a particular (inner) amplicon region if any aligned bases overlap that region.

The percentage of all amplicons that were considered to have a sufficient proportion of
assigned reads (70%) that covered the whole amplicon target from 'end-to-end'. To allow for error

@Coverage Overview
Base coverage is shown across the whole reference (genome).
The effective reference is created from a concatenation of the chromosomes or individual target regions
(in the relative position they appear in the reference sequence).
Each point plotted is the base 10 logorithm value of the total aligned base read count within an equal length (1/600) of the effective reference.

@Target Coverage
Target base coverage is plotted against read depth, where read depth is the number of times
a particular base is read and coverage is the number of counts of bases read at that read depth.
The right hand y-axis shows the cumulative coverage as a percentage of the total number of target base
reads, corresponding to the light blue line plot. This may be used to gauge to percentage of target
bases read to a particular depth. To better show the coverage curve, the 0x coverage data point may be
omitted and the read depth (x-axis) limited to show the lower 99.5% coverage percentile.
