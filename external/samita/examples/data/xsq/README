I created these files using HDFView to edit some old prototypes from Chengyong.

There are ambiguities in the specification for which I had to guess.  Some of the data is
completely bogus.   These files should not be considered to be official XSQ files.

The 'bs','c11' and 'c1303' strings refer to base, 2-base and 4 base encoded data in the files.
