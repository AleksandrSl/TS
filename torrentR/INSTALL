The following instructions describe how to compile and install the torrentR
package from source.  Note that compiling the torrentR package requires
compilation of code from the Ion torrent Analysis package, so make sure that
you have the Analysis codebase located in the same directory in which torrentR
is located.

Note also that this build has been validated only on Ubuntu linux 10.04 - the
same OS that the Torrent Server runs.

1) Install a collection of debian packages required for building and using
   torrentR

     sudo apt-get install \
       build-essential \
       cmake \
       liblapack-dev \
       liblapack3gf \
       libblas-dev \
       libblas3gf \
       libatlas-base-dev \
       libatlas-headers \
       gfortran \
       zlib1g-dev \
       libgsl0-dev \
       imagemagick

2) Install R and a collection of R debian packages - not all are required for
   installing torrentR but it is a good idea to grab the full list as the rest
   are used by one or more plug-ins.

     sudo apt-get install \
       r-base \
       r-base-dev \
       r-base-latex \
       r-cran-lattice \
       r-cran-cluster \
       r-cran-hmisc \
       r-cran-mass \
       r-cran-rcolorbrewer \
       r-cran-rocr \
       r-cran-gplots \
       r-cran-colorspace \
       r-cran-bitops \
       r-cran-catools\
       r-cran-gdata \
       r-cran-gtools

3) Get some R packages for which there is no debian package - these we will
   install from source.  The only ones that are requried for installation of
   torrentR are Rcpp, spam and fields, the rest are good to have because some
   plug-ins use them.

     for PKG in \
       Rcpp_0.7.8.tar.gz \
       spam_0.22-0.tar.gz \
       plyr_1.0.3.tar.gz \
       reshape_0.8.3.tar.gz \
       proto_0.3-8.tar.gz; do
         PREFIX=${PKG%%_*.tar.gz}
         wget http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/$PREFIX/$PKG
         sudo R CMD INSTALL $PKG
     done
     for PKG in fields_6.3.tar.gz; do
       wget http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/$PKG
       sudo R CMD INSTALL $PKG
     done

4) Compile torrentR from source using the cmake build system

     MODULES=torrentR ./buildTools/build.sh 

5) Install torrentR.  There are a few options at this point:

   5.1) System-wide installation from compiled source for all users.

     sudo R CMD INSTALL torrentR

   5.2) System-wide installation from debian package.  Using this
        option will pull in various other debian packages identified
        above if they are not present already, even though they are
        not strictly speaking required to run torrentR itself, though
        some plug-ins do requrie them.

     sudo dpkg -i 

   5.3) Installation from source to a specific location.  This option
        will install torrentR in a directory specified by the user (which
        must exist).  When using this approach it is often convenient to
        set the R_LIBS environment variable to the library location so
        that it will be automatically found when running R, otherwise one
        needs to use the lib.loc option when calling library() in torrentR

     R CMD INSTALL -l ~/lib/R torrentR

6) Launch R and confirm that library(torrentR) executes without error.

7) To get started, read the torrentR vignette which can be found
   in torrentR/inst/doc/torrentR-intro.pdf

   If you make changes and want to rebuild the vignette a couple of
   tex packages are required:

     sudo apt-get install \
       texlive-latex-recommended \
       texinfo
     R CMD build torrentR
