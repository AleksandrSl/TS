Purpose of this development is to enable Configuration Management on the Ion Torrent Server.  This
effectively replaces the ad-hoc scripts (ts_functions, et al.) currently used to configure a server. 
The goal is to enable consistent configuration management for stand-alone servers as well as Ion
Clusters.

===== 
Before running the provisioning command, each compute node needs to have secure-key access
setup.  For each compute node, run:

ssh-copy ionadmin@<<compute hostname>>

This assumes you are running as ionadmin user on the headnode, and that you have previously created an
ssh key with:

ssh-keygen

=====
Still a work in progress.  But for now, there are two files which need manual editing.

torrentsuite_hosts:

The local hostname will automatically appear under [headnode].  It is put there during package installation.
If this is a cluster installation, put the hostname(s) of the compute nodes under [computes].



vars/nfs_client:

1 - If there are NAS storage units that need to be NFS mounted on each compute resource, add them under the
nas_mounts: category with an entry like so:

  - { name: <<nas hostname>>, directory: <<exported directory>>, mountpoint: <<local mountpoint>> }
  
Note: Space character after the colon is important!



host_vars/<<hostname>>:

Put site-specific variable definitions in this file.
For instance, to override the default apt repository (ionupdates.com) for an Ion internal site:
The following would use lucid-alpha at updates.ite:

---
ion_repository_hostname: updates.ite
ion_build_flag: "-alpha/"


==================================
ION CLUSTER IN STANDALONE
==================================
This refers to a system like TRI which started with a single Torrent Server, then expanded to three and made one of the Torrent Servers the master and the rest compute nodes.  The new master node exports its /results partition.  This needs to be entered into vars/nfs_client file as

nas_mounts:
  - { name: <<hostname>>, directory: /results, mountpoint: /results }
  
The nfs_client configuration knows enough not to mount this volume upon the same host that is exporting.


==================================
ION CLUSTER SETUP DETAILED NOTES
==================================
Assumes the headnode will not be a compute node.

Assumes that the /results partition will be on an external NAS.  This requires that the /results NFS mount be completed prior to installing the iontorrent_master role because some Ion packages install by default to the /results directory.  ie. nfs_client needs to execute prior to iontorrent_master.

Assumes no instruments will be direct connected.  Thus, we can skip the fileserver role.  Edit hosts inventory file and remove any entry under [fileserver].
