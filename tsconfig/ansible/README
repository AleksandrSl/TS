Purpose of this development is to enable Configuration Management on the Ion Torrent Server.  This
effectively replaces the ad-hoc scripts (ts_functions, et al.) currently used to configure a server. 
The goal is to enable consistent configuration management for stand-alone servers as well as Ion
Clusters.

=====
Still a work in progress.  But for now, there are two files which need manual editing.

torrentsuite_hosts:
To prevent package updates from overwriting this file, create a copy named torrentsuite_hosts_local and make customizations to that instead.

The local hostname will automatically appear under [headnode].  It is put there during package installation.

If this is a cluster installation, put the hostname(s) of the compute nodes under [computes].


group_vars/all:
To prevent package updates from overwriting this file, create a copy named group_vars/all_local and make customizations to that instead.

1 - If there are NAS storage units that need to be NFS mounted on each compute resource, add them under the
nas_mounts: category with an entry like so:

  - { name: <<nas hostname>>, directory: <<exported directory>>, mountpoint: <<local mountpoint>>, options: defaults }
  
Note: Space character after the colon is important!


host_vars/<<hostname>>:

Put site-specific variable definitions in this file.


==================================
ION CLUSTER IN STANDALONE
==================================
This refers to a system like TRI which started with a single Torrent Server, then expanded to three and made one of the Torrent Servers the master and the rest compute nodes.  The new master node exports its /results partition.  This needs to be entered into group_vars/all file as

nas_mounts:
  - { name: <<hostname>>, directory: /results, mountpoint: /results }
  
The nfs_client configuration knows enough not to mount this volume upon the same host that is exporting.


==================================
ION CLUSTER SETUP DETAILED NOTES
==================================
Assumes the headnode will not be a compute node.

Assumes that the /results partition will be on an external NAS.  This requires that the /results NFS mount be completed prior to installing the iontorrent_master role because some Ion packages install by default to the /results directory.  ie. nfs_client needs to execute prior to iontorrent_master.

Assumes no instruments will be direct connected.  Thus, we can skip the fileserver role.  Edit hosts inventory file and remove any entry under [fileserver].
