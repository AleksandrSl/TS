\subsection{Detailed Description}
An implementation of a lock that is extremely simple to use. Given some level of scope, the lock will be obtained once that scope is reached, and released once this object goes out of scope.

\{//start scope ScopedLock(Lockable); all code from here on is in a mutually exclusive code block until \hyperlink{class_scoped_lock}{ScopedLock} goes out of scope \}//end scope
