MaskEmpty - By default, all wells are marked as empty at the beginning of
processing.

MaskExclude - Any well that falls outside the usable area of the chip.  Defined
by an exclusion mask file found in /opt/ion/config.

MaskPinned - Any well with signal that is either 0 or 16383 in any frame.  Also,
any signal "near" these values.  Its a two part algorithm.  Nearness is
determined by using a histogram of the signals, at frame 10, to determine
outliers and marking them as Pinned.  Outliers are +/- 4000 from maxima. 
(High/Low filter is under review: might only have been necessary in the dark
ages)

MaskBead - Beadfind files supply data used to cluster all "empty" wells' signals
into two groups: the empties and the beads.  Value used for clustering is
(max-abs(min)) of NN-subtracted trace.  First group is empties while second
group is marked MaskBead.  (Prior to beadfind, wells are filtered for pinned
wells and excluded from beadfind analysis)

MaskWashout - Any well that was found to pass beadfind using the pre-Run
beadfind file, but did not pass beadfind using the post-Run beadfind file. 
Thus, presumed to have washed out of the well.

MaskLive (MaskTF,MaskLib)
MaskDud
MaskAmbiguous

Key flows are used to calculate average 1 mer signal level (This is done for
each key).  If greater than a threshold, well is marked MaskLive.  In addition,
since there are two keys, whichever key generated the threshold-passing signal,
the well is marked with MaskTF or MaskLib.  If the well fails threshold for both
keys, it is marked MaskDud.  If it exceeds threshold for both keys, it is marked
MaskAmbiguous.

MaskIgnore - Any well that should no longer be considered for anything during
the processing.  Detect a Nan during Flux Integration calculations or
application of weka vector to raw data.  Excluding top 10% of empties during
beadfind.  During beadfind, mark a region to be ignored during subsequent
processing due to insufficient number of beads in region.  (0.5% of wells in
region).  During NN-subtract, if there are insufficient empties to subtract
from a well, mark the well MaskIgnore.

MaskKeypass - After basecalling, if the well passes the keypass filter, this bit
gets set.  This read will be written to an SFF file.
